# -AlgoSched - CPU Scheduling Algorithms Simulator
Developed a comprehensive CPU Scheduling Algorithms Simulator to explore both non-preemptive and preemptive techniques, including FCFS, SJF, SRTF, Priority Scheduling, and Round-Robin. 

This project provides an  interface for selecting algorithms, inputting process parameters, and analyzing key performance metrics such as average turnaround time, waiting time, and total throughput.

The project analyzes and compares different algorithms to determine the most efficient approach for various process execution scenarios, enhancing understanding of optimal CPU resource management and contributing to improved system performance in real-worldÂ applications.
